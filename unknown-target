Enhancement Guidelines
======================

This document provides guidelines on generating and applying the best possible enhancement for CPython.

Identifying Areas for Improvement
---------------------------------

1. Review the existing codebase and documentation to identify potential areas for improvement.
2. Consider performance, security, usability, and maintainability when identifying areas for enhancement.
3. Gather feedback from users, contributors, and maintainers to identify common pain points and areas for improvement.

Proposing Enhancements
----------------------

1. Clearly define the problem or area for improvement.
2. Research and evaluate potential solutions, considering their feasibility and impact on the codebase.
3. Write a detailed enhancement proposal, including the following sections:
   - **Title**: A concise and descriptive title for the enhancement.
   - **Abstract**: A brief summary of the enhancement and its benefits.
   - **Motivation**: A detailed explanation of the problem or area for improvement and why it is important to address.
   - **Proposed Solution**: A detailed description of the proposed solution, including any relevant code changes, design considerations, and potential trade-offs.
   - **Implementation Plan**: A step-by-step plan for implementing the enhancement, including any necessary tests and documentation updates.
   - **Impact Analysis**: An analysis of the potential impact of the enhancement on the codebase, including any potential risks or challenges.

Implementing Changes
--------------------

1. Follow the implementation plan outlined in the enhancement proposal.
2. Write clear, concise, and well-documented code that adheres to the project's coding standards and guidelines.
3. Write tests to verify the correctness and performance of the enhancement.
4. Update any relevant documentation to reflect the changes made by the enhancement.
5. Submit a pull request with the implemented changes, including a link to the enhancement proposal and any relevant tests and documentation updates.

Examples and Best Practices
---------------------------

1. Provide clear and concise examples of the enhancement in action, including any relevant code snippets or usage instructions.
2. Follow best practices for writing effective enhancement proposals, such as:
   - Clearly defining the problem and proposed solution.
   - Providing a detailed implementation plan and impact analysis.
   - Writing clear, concise, and well-documented code.
   - Writing tests to verify the correctness and performance of the enhancement.
   - Updating relevant documentation to reflect the changes made by the enhancement.
